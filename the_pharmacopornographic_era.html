            <p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he personal account of continuous conflict between the rise of neo-liberalism and fascist dreams,
            conservative values and the breaking of gender taboos, cars and recession. The narrative quickly segues,
            aptly, into the transhumanist historical account with pharmacological and pornographic view.</p>

            <p>Cold War is the period of time when sexuality has taken a very important role in building a national
            identity, and the government has done a lot of work in the field:</p>

            <h3>Pharmacologic</h3>
            <p>At the end of 40s the notion of hormone has become a subject of scientific inquiry. By the end of 40s first
            molecules of progesterone and estrogen were extracted from the urine of pregnant women. Shortly after that
            the first synthetic hormone, Norethindrone, was commercialised.
            Harold Gilles, a UK surgeon, through 13 phalloplastic surgeries and testosterone administration protocol to
            affirm masculinisation, successfully completes the first female-to-male transition on Michael Dillon.
            The first openly discussed male-to-female transition of a US Soldier George W. Jorgensen to Christine is
            sucessfully completed in 1952.</p>
            <p>First contraceptive pill was invented in 1957 and approved four years later. The Pill has become the first
            biochemical method of distinction between heterosexual pleasure from reproduction, forever changing the
            discourse of heterosexuality.</p>

            <h3>Pornographic</h3>
            <p>An ex-sex worker (and a spy) Martha Richard convinces the French government to shut-down state-sanctioned
            brothel system in 1946.</p>
            <p>Hugh Hefner in 1953 publishes first issue of *Playboy* — the first “pornographic” magazine coy enough to be
            sold at the newspaper stand. Marilyn Monroe is in the centerfold. 6 years later Hugh Hefner turns an old
            Chicago house into a much publicised *Playboy Mansion* — a 32 rooms American erotic utopia.</p>
            <p>Produced by Gerald Damiano, starred by Linda Lovelace, *Deep Throat* was one of the America's most watched film
            of all times (USD 600mln).</p>

            <h3>Discursive</h3>
            <p>A massive quantitative study “Sex Variants” undertaken by George Henry in 1949 leads to the term “sexual
            deviancy”.</p>
            <p>Unprecedented study on human sexuality undertaken by Alfred Kinsey.
            At its peak of McCarthyism, America was fighting two, seemingly opposite fights simultaneously — the fight
            against communism as the enemy of the state, and homosexuality as the enemy of family values.
            John Money, an American pedo-psychiatrist, has coined the term “gender”, clearly differentiating it from
            biological sex.</p>
