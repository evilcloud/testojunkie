    </div>
    <div class="main">
    <p>A self-depreciating attempt to cope with a death of a friend. The coping turns into a ritualised act of group
        therapy run by a bunch of anonymous disenfranchised people acting out on their gender dysphoria.
    </p>
    <p>A subject of surveillance is touched, but no substantial commitment was made on the topic, aside from implication
        of it being the case as the consequence of her/his continuous act of exhibitionism.
    </p>
    <p>Three word-pairs come to mind:</p>

    <h2>The narrative</h2>
    <p>The initial character settings is a bit confusing:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the book (or chapter, rather) is an memoir (the reliability of the narrative is a huge question, raised by
            the author himself)</li>
        <li>the trigger of the events, including the book, is the death of William, a friend deeply admired by the
            author.</li>
        <li>the author is participating in a group of like-minded individuals who transform their bodies into the
            opposite sex by the use of grey market pharmaceuticals and questionable rites</li>
    </ul>
