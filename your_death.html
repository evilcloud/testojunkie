            <p><span class="first-letter">A</span> self-depreciating attempt to cope with a death of a friend. The
                coping turns into a ritualised act of group
                therapy run by a bunch of anonymous disenfranchised people acting out on their gender dysphoria.
            </p>
            <p>A subject of surveillance is touched, but no substantial commitment was made on the topic, aside from
                implication
                of it being the case as the consequence of her/his continuous act of exhibitionism.

                <li>the trigger of the events, including the book, is the death of William, a friend deeply admired by

                <li>the author is participating in a group of like-minded individuals who transform their bodies into
                    the

            <p><strong>NB</strong> The book specified in the list provided by the author is claimed to be authored by William, the deseased
                friend. However, during the act of filming the protagonist performs act of sexual nature with the book
                <em>My Room</em> by Guillaume Dustan, who has passed away in 2005. First edition of Testo Junkie was
                published in 2005, and thus we are ambivalent wether Guillame Dustan is in fact William, or if our
                protagonist is an unreliable narrator.
